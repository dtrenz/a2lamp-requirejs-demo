An over simplified and contrived example of how to use RequireJS, created for a live coding demo during a talk I gave to the [A2LAMP meetup group](http://a2lamp.com).

Branches:
- master: basic project exmple (w/o RequireJS)
- requirejs: converted project using RequireJS
- grunt: project set-up for optimization & deployment using Grunt to manage RequireJS task
